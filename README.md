# Glitch in the system

# 👋 Hi, I'm a Curious Computer Science Explorer

Welcome to my little corner of the digital world!  
I’m someone who can’t help but ask **“how does this actually work?”** — and that question is the engine behind everything I do in computer science.

## 🌱 About Me

I’m endlessly curious. If something catches my attention — a new language, an odd bug, a cool research paper — I’ll dive into it just to understand what’s happening underneath. Learning isn’t a task for me; it’s a habit.

## 🔍 How I Think

### ❓ I Ask A Lot of Questions  
I’m always exploring the *why* and *how* behind systems.  
Questions like:  
- “Why is this slow?”  
- “What if I change this?”  
- “Can this be automated?”  
They often lead me down fascinating rabbit holes.

### 🧪 I Love Experimenting  
Most of my side projects start with curiosity.  
Some because I wanted to try a new idea —  
others because I broke something and learned from fixing it.

### 🐛 I Enjoy Debugging  
Tracing weird bugs feels like detective work.  
Every stack trace tells a story, and I like following it to the end.

### 📚 I Read… A Lot  
Documentation, research papers, GitHub issues, blog posts, niche forums —  
if there’s something to learn, I’m interested.

## 🛠️ What I Like to Build

- Tools that make life easier  
- Experimental projects no one asked for  
- Prototypes for testing random ideas  
- Anything that helps me understand a concept better  

Sometimes they’re useful. Sometimes they’re chaotic.  
But they always teach me something.

## 🚀 Why I Do This

Because curiosity is fun.  
Because discovery is addictive.  
Because every “aha!” moment reminds me why I love computer science.
