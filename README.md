👋 Hi, I'm Z3r0S3nt1n3l

💻 Computer Science Enthusiast | Aspiring Developer | Digital Explorer

🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate computer science enthusiast who believes in the power of code and the interconnected nature of technology. I’m currently on an exciting journey to turn that enthusiasm into tangible skills by formally learning computer science concepts and building practical applications.

This profile tracks my progress, projects, and learning resources as I delve into the digital frontier!

💡 Current Focus & Projects

I am actively focusing on foundational technologies to build a strong base:

🌐 Basic Web Development: Getting hands-on with the core of the web—HTML for structure and JavaScript for interactivity.

📚 Computer Science Fundamentals: Simultaneously diving into the essential theories, data structures, and algorithms that underpin all software development.

You'll find my earliest attempts at creating simple web pages and basic scripts here. I see every project, no matter how small, as a stepping stone!

🔭 Future Horizons

My roadmap for future learning is ambitious and focused on systems and backend development:

Area of Study

Goal

Why?

Go (Golang)
